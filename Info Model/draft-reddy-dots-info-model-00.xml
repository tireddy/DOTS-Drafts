    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the need and the mechanisms to dynamically
      update configuration of network monitoring devices to help identify
      distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in a network. Once an
      attack is signalled by a client or detected locally, provisioning cycles
      are triggered to program a set of network elements to undertake
      appropriate actions (including, blackhole, drop, rate-limit, or add to
      watch list) on the suspect traffic.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make
      machines or network resources unavailable to their intended users. In
      most cases, sufficient scale can be achieved by compromising enough
      end-hosts and using those infected hosts to perpetrate and amplify the
      attack. The victim in this attack can be an application server, a client
      or router, a firewall, or an entire network, etc. Typically, enterprises
      configure network elements or monitoring devices (appliances) to export
      traffic flow information for further processing by applications hosted
      on other devices, such as DDoS monitoring applications.</t>

      <t>DDoS monitoring applications analyze and correlate flow records to
      baseline proper behaviour and measure deviation from that expected norm
      ("Observed" vs. "Expected"). Analytics is applied to deliver a baseline
      of the network in normal operation conditions and then to highlight when
      an anomalous event occurs. As DDoS attacks get more complex and more
      sophisticated, DDoS monitoring applications may need more or different
      fields in the flow records, change the frequency of flow record
      collection, increase the granularity of flow record collection for
      traffic to a network resource, tweak the sampling logic, enable or
      disable packet sampling, modify the packet selection technique for
      sampling, etc. to adjust their decision-making process for a better
      detection efficiency.</t>

      <t>This document explains mechanisms to dynamically change the
      configuration of IPFIX-compliant Monitoring Devices (<xref
      target="RFC7011"></xref>) and PSAMP-compliant Monitoring Devices (<xref
      target="RFC5476"></xref>) using the Network Configuration Protocol
      (NETCONF) <xref target="RFC6241"></xref> to identify attacks on the
      network and once an attack is detected use NETCONF to program
      appropriate filtering rules on a set of network devices. In addition to
      the required intelligence to decide which actions are needed, a
      decision-making process to decide "where" (i.e., which network elements)
      these filtering actions are to be performed.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Solution Overview">
      <t>Flow collector (or DDoS monitoring application) needs to program
      IPFIX- and PSAMP-compliant monitoring devices using vendor-independent
      configuration data model. A vendor-independent configuration data model
      helps to store and manage the configuration data of Monitoring Devices
      in a consistent format. The data model could be specified using YANG
      <xref target="RFC6020"></xref> to dynamically configure monitoring
      devices. The configuration data models for IPFIX and PSAMP is discussed
      in <xref target="RFC6728"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In order to offer more automation and dynamicity in changing the
      configuration of network monitoring, this document proposes an
      architecture that is composed of two parts:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Flow Collector communicates the configuration of network
          monitoring to the DOTS Controller. This assumes the flow controller
          has been provisioned with the locator(s) of DOTS Controller to
          contact. For multi-homed networks, the Flow Controller should
          contact the DOTS Controller attached to the network from which the
          suspect traffic is received from.</t>

          <t>The DOTS Controller is responsible to configure the monitoring
          devices. This assumes the DOTS Controller has access to the
          underlying network topology (including the interconnection map and
          the set of advanced service functions).</t>

      <t>Definitions:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Flow Collector:">A Flow Collector (referred to as
          Collector) receives flow records from one or more monitoring devices
          (referred to as Exporters). Flow records consist of information
          elements such as IP addresses, application, ports, interfaces,
          packets and other details relevant for DDoS monitoring and
          analysis.</t>

          <t hangText="Controller:">A Controller is an orchestration point
          that receives abstract monitoring intents or profiles and then
          translates them to device-specific configurations and delivers them
          to monitoring devices via the "Config Manager".</t>

          <t hangText="Monitoring Devices :">These are devices in the network
          that are provisioned to monitor network flows, collect information
          and export them to a "Flow Collector".</t>
        </list></t>

      <t><xref target="figure1"></xref> provides a high level overview of the
      solution. The proposed solution is to build a dynamic configuration
      model in DDoS Monitoring using a feedback system where a Flow Collector
      can influence monitoring configurations on the devices to gather
      information about a potential DDoS event.</t>

      <t>The sequences marked (1)-(5) in <xref target="figure1"></xref> refers
      to the work flow of the proposed solution, these flows can be largely
      categorized into three phases:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Initial Provisioning Cycle: Represents the initial state of the
          monitoring configuration where an administrator updates the
          Controller with a default or preliminary monitoring configuration
          delivered to monitoring devices. For example, the initial
          configuration on the Monitoring Devices is to collect information
          elements such as IP addresses/prefixes, application type, transport
          ports, flow timestamps, interfaces and so on.</t>

          <t>Flow Monitoring: Refers to the activity of Monitoring Devices to
          inspect and watch network flows. Based on the monitoring
          configuration, the Monitoring Device is instructed to collect
          specific flow information and export them to a "Flow Collector".</t>

          <t>Flow Collection and Analysis: A "Flow Collector" device collects
          and (possibly) aggregates flow information from one or more
          Monitoring Devices. As the Collector continues to gather more and
          more data, it can potentially correlate and analyze flow information
          to "guess" or determine if a DDoS event is in progress. If so, the
          Flow Collector may consider gathering additional data from the
          monitoring devices and signals this intent to a "Controller".</t>

          <t>Re-provisioning Cycle: The Controller receives from the "Flow
          Collector", the intent to re-provision Monitoring Devices to produce
          additional flow information elements. The Controller, then, delivers
          the new or updated configuration to the appropriate Monitoring
          Devices.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The other provisioning interface is the one between the DOTS
      Controller and network elements. Concretely, when the Flow Collector
      identifies an active attack, it signals to the DOTS Controller the set
      of traffic identification information (including all suspect IP
      addresses) together with a suggested action (e.g., rate-limit, drop,
      monitor). Then, the DOTS Controller propagates the filtering rules to
      the network elements (including routers, middleboxes). The Flow
      Collector, after certain duration, requests the rules to block traffic
      from these IP addresses be removed once the attack has stopped. Note,
      <xref target="RFC6088"></xref> provides typical information that can be
      included in the traffic identification information set.</t>

      defined: the one used by a client to signal appropriate filtering rules
      to an controller (for example, [I-D.reddy-ddos-mitigation] can be used

      <t>The authentication mechanism between the Flow Collector and DOTS
      Controller should be immune to pervasive monitoring <xref
      target="RFC7258"></xref>. An attacker can intercept traffic by
      installing rules that would lead to redirect all or part of the traffic
      to an illegitimate Flow Collector. Means to protect against attacks that
      would lead to install, remove, or modify rules must be supported.</t>

      <t>In order to protect against denial of service that would be caused by
      a misbehaving trusted Flow Collector, DOTS Controller should rate limit
      the configuration changes received from a Flow Collector.</t>
